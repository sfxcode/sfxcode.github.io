### New Sapphire Demo Release.

3 Demo Apps based on sapphire-core included.


![Sapphire Core Login Demo]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/sapphire/sapphire-login-demo.jpg)


Tested with JDK8u102

* Updated to sapphire-core 1.1.7

#### Dropped scalafxml support

I decided to drop scalafxml because there of not enough additional value 
to dispense with fxml autocompletion in an IDE like IntelliJ.
